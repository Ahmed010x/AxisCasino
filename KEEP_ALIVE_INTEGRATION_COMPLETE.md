# Keep-Alive Integration Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
The Telegram Casino Bot now includes an integrated keep-alive web server to ensure reliable deployment on platforms like Render, Railway, Heroku, and other cloud services that require an open HTTP port.

## What Was Added

### 1. Keep-Alive Server Integration
- **Flask Server**: Integrated directly into `main.py`
- **Threading**: Runs in a separate daemon thread alongside the Telegram bot
- **Multiple Endpoints**: Health check and status endpoints
- **Port Configuration**: Uses `PORT` environment variable (defaults to 8080)

### 2. Server Endpoints
- **`/`** - Basic "Casino Bot is running!" message
- **`/health`** - Health check endpoint with JSON response
- **`/status`** - Detailed status with bot version, demo mode, and timestamp

### 3. Integration Points
- **Main Function**: Automatically starts keep-alive server before bot
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if server fails to start
- **Threading**: Non-blocking daemon thread won't prevent bot shutdown

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
PORT=8080                    # Web server port (default: 8080)
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token    # Required for bot functionality
```

### Deployment Files Updated
- **`Procfile`**: Now uses single `web: python main.py` command
- **`requirements.txt`**: Flask already included
- **`main.py`**: Integrated server startup

## Usage

### Local Development
```bash
python main.py
```
Output will show:
```
üåê Starting keep-alive server on port 8080
‚úÖ Keep-alive server started on port 8080
üé∞ Starting Casino Bot with Multi-Asset Support...
```

### Production Deployment
1. **Render/Railway**: Use `web: python main.py` (already in Procfile)
2. **Heroku**: Same as above
3. **VPS**: Run with `python main.py` or use process manager

### Health Checks
- **Basic**: `GET /` returns "Casino Bot is running!"
- **Health**: `GET /health` returns `{"status": "healthy", "bot": "casino", "version": "2.0.1"}`
- **Status**: `GET /status` returns detailed JSON with bot info

## Benefits

### 1. Deployment Platform Compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Render**: Requires web service with open port
- ‚úÖ **Railway**: Supports web services
- ‚úÖ **Heroku**: Free tier requires web dyno
- ‚úÖ **Other Platforms**: Most cloud services support this pattern

### 2. Monitoring & Health Checks
- External monitoring services can ping health endpoints
- Load balancers can check service availability
- Easy to integrate with uptime monitoring

### 3. Zero Downtime
- Server runs in daemon thread
- Bot continues working if server fails
- Automatic restart attempts for bot failures

## Technical Details

### Server Architecture
```python
def create_keep_alive_server():
    """Creates Flask app with health endpoints"""
    
def start_keep_alive_server():
    """Starts server in daemon thread"""
    
# In main():
start_keep_alive_server()  # Non-blocking
asyncio.run(run_bot())     # Main bot process
```

### Thread Safety
- Flask server runs in separate daemon thread
- No shared state between server and bot
- Bot can restart without affecting server

## Testing

Run the integration test:
```bash
python test_keep_alive_integration.py
```

Expected output:
```
üéâ All tests passed! Keep-alive integration is ready for deployment.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check port availability: `lsof -i :8080`
- Verify Flask installation: `pip install Flask`
- Check logs for port conflicts

### Bot Still Not Staying Alive
- Ensure platform recognizes web service
- Check platform-specific keep-alive requirements
- Verify external health check configuration

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: Server runs in daemon thread
- No impact on bot response times
- Low memory footprint (~5-10MB additional)

## Migration Notes

### From Previous Setup
- Old `keep_alive.py` is no longer used
- Procfile simplified to single command
- No changes needed to bot functionality

### Environment Variables
- All existing variables work unchanged
- Only `PORT` variable added for server
- Backward compatible with existing deployments
