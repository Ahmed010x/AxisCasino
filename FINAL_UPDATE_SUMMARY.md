# ‚úÖ FINAL UPDATE: Dice Predict Quick Bets Always Visible

## What Was Done
Updated Dice Predict so quick bet options **always show**, even when user has $0.00 balance.

## The Change
```python
# BEFORE ‚ùå
for bet in quick_bets:
    if bet <= balance:  # Hidden if balance too low
        row.append(...)

# AFTER ‚úÖ
for bet in quick_bets:
    row.append(...)  # Always shown
```

## User Experience
- User with $0: Sees all bet buttons, gets clear error if they click
- User with $3: Sees all bet buttons, validation happens when they commit
- User with $50+: Normal flow, no changes

## Result
‚úÖ Better transparency  
‚úÖ Consistent UX  
‚úÖ New users can browse options  
‚úÖ Clear error messages
