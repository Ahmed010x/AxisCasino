## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User selects "🔮 Dice Predict" from games menu
2. Choose bet amount
3. Select predicted number (1-6)
4. Bot rolls dice with animation
5. Result is displayed with updated balance
6. Option to play again with same/double bet

- Number emojis (1️⃣ 2️⃣ 3️⃣ 4️⃣ 5️⃣ 6️⃣)
- Color-coded results (green for win, red for loss)
- Clear profit/loss display

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
- **`bot/games/dice_predict.py`**: Complete game logic
  - Bet handling
  - Number selection UI
  - Dice rolling (RNG)
  - Win/loss calculation
  - Balance updates
  - Game logging

### Files Modified
- **`main.py`**:
  - Added dice_predict import
  - Registered callback handlers
  - Added to games menu
  - Added custom bet handler
  - Added placeholder for fallback

### Integration Points
- ✅ Game sessions logging
- ✅ House balance tracking
- ✅ Referral commission (on losses)
- ✅ User balance updates

## Game Logic

### Random Number Generation
```python
actual_number = random.randint(1, 6)
```
- Uses Python's `random.randint()` for fair RNG
- Range: 1 to 6 inclusive
- Independent of Telegram's dice animation

### Payout Calculation
```python
if won:
    win_amount = bet_amount * 5.0
    net_profit = win_amount - bet_amount
else:
    win_amount = 0.0
    net_profit = -bet_amount
```

### Balance Updates
1. Deduct bet before rolling
2. If win: Add win_amount to balance
3. If loss: Nothing (already deducted)
4. Update house balance accordingly
