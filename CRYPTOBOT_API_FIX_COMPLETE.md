# CryptoBot API Fix Complete âœ…

## Issue Resolved
The "METHOD_NOT_FOUND 405" error when creating deposits has been successfully fixed.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by environment configuration issues and improved error handling was needed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration âœ…
- **Fixed**: CryptoBot API token loading from `env.litecoin`
- **Verified**: Token `460025:AAEvVXDgoWrNR...` is valid and working
- **Added**: Debug logging to track token loading

### 2. API Endpoint Verification âœ…
- **Confirmed**: Using correct `/createInvoice` endpoint (not `/createPayment`)
- **Tested**: CryptoBot API responds with 200 status and valid invoice data
- **Verified**: All invoice URLs are generated correctly:
  - Pay URL: `https://t.me/CryptoBot?start=<hash>`
  - Mini App URL: `https://t.me/CryptoBot/app?startapp=invoice-<hash>&mode=compact`
  - Web App URL: `https://app.cr.bot/invoices/<hash>`

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling âœ…
- **Added**: Comprehensive logging for API requests and responses
- **Improved**: Error message formatting with specific error codes
- **Added**: Token validation logging on startup

### 4. Testing Results âœ…
```
âœ… CryptoBot API getMe: 200 OK
