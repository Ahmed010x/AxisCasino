## Technical Implementation

### Owner Check Function
```python
def is_owner(user_id: int) -> bool:
    """Check if user is the owner (super admin)"""
    return user_id == OWNER_USER_ID
```

### Enhanced Start Command
```python
# Add owner panel for owner and admin panel for owner
if is_owner(user_id):
    keyboard.append([
        InlineKeyboardButton("üëë Owner Panel", callback_data="owner_panel"), 
        InlineKeyboardButton("‚öôÔ∏è Admin Panel", callback_data="admin_panel")
    ])
elif is_admin(user_id):
    keyboard.append([InlineKeyboardButton("‚öôÔ∏è Admin Panel", callback_data="admin_panel")])
```

### Panel Switching Logic
```python
@handle_errors
async def owner_user_view_callback(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    """Switch owner to user view (normal user interface)"""
    # Shows regular user interface with "Back to Owner Panel" button
    
@handle_errors  
async def owner_panel_callback(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    """Owner panel with comprehensive system control"""
    # Shows full owner dashboard with all management tools
```
