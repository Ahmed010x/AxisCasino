# 🛠️ ALL PROBLEMS FIXED - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Missing Core Bot Logic**
- ❌ **Problem**: The main.py file was incomplete, missing essential bot handlers and the main function
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added complete bot implementation with:
  - `async_main()` function with proper bot startup
  - All essential command handlers (`/start`, `/balance`, `/help`)
  - Callback query handlers for all bot features
  - Proper conversation flow management

### 2. **Input Clash Prevention** 
- ❌ **Problem**: User input could clash between game states and deposit/withdrawal flows
- ✅ **Fixed**: Implemented robust state management:
  - `context.user_data.clear()` at the start of each major flow
  - `handle_text_input_main()` only processes deposit/withdrawal states
  - Global fallback handlers for all conversation flows
  - Proper state isolation between different bot functions

### 3. **House Balance System Implementation**

- ✅ **Fixed**: Complete house balance system:
  - Database table for house balance tracking
  - Real-time updates on all financial transactions
  - Comprehensive profit/loss calculations
  - House edge percentage tracking
  - Integration with all deposit/withdrawal flows

  - Real-time house balance updates
