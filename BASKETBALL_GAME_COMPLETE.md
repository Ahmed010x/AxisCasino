## Command Reference

## Math & Fairness

### Expected Value (House Edge)
- **SCORE Bet**: (0.4 √ó 1.8) - (0.6 √ó 1) = 0.72 - 0.6 = 0.12 (12% advantage to house)
- **MISS Bet**: (0.6 √ó 1.5) - (0.4 √ó 1) = 0.9 - 0.4 = 0.5 (50% advantage to house)

Wait, let me recalculate...

- **SCORE Bet**: Win 40% of time (0.4), get 1.8x back
  - EV = (0.4 √ó 0.8) - (0.6 √ó 1) = 0.32 - 0.6 = -0.28 (28% house edge - TOO HIGH)
  
Let me fix the payouts to be more fair:

### Recommended Payout Adjustments
- **SCORE Bet**: Should pay 2.3x (0.4 √ó 1.3 - 0.6 √ó 1 = -0.08 = 8% house edge)
- **MISS Bet**: Should pay 1.6x (0.6 √ó 0.6 - 0.4 √ó 1 = -0.04 = 4% house edge)

Current implementation has higher house edge which favors the casino more. This is acceptable for a casino game but could be adjusted if needed.
