# Mini App Centre Fix Report

## Problem Identified
The Mini App Centre was not working because many callback handlers were missing from the main callback router. Users clicking buttons would see placeholder messages instead of the intended functionality.

## Root Cause
The callback handler in `main.py` only handled a few specific callbacks:
- `main_panel`
- `mini_app_centre` 
- `show_balance`
- `deposit`
- `withdraw`

All other callbacks (like `bonus_centre`, `show_stats`, `show_leaderboard`, etc.) were redirected to a placeholder handler that showed "This feature is coming soon!"

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Callback Router
Updated `handle_callback()` function to handle all callback types:

```python
# Main navigation callbacks
- main_panel
- mini_app_centre
- show_balance
- show_stats
- show_leaderboard
- show_help
- bonus_centre

# Financial operation callbacks
- deposit
- withdraw
- deposit_* (all deposit methods)
- withdraw_* (all withdraw methods)

# Bonus operation callbacks
- claim_daily_bonus
- get_referral
- show_achievements
- bonus_history
```
