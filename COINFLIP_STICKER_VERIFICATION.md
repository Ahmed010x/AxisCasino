2. User selects bet amount → sees Bitcoin vs Ethereum choice
3. User picks Bitcoin (HEADS) or Ethereum (TAILS)
4. **Bot sends:**
   - "🎰 FLIPPING COIN..." message
   - **Actual crypto sticker** (Bitcoin or Ethereum)
   - Result message confirming the outcome
   - Win/loss summary with balance

### Example Flow:
```
User: Chooses Bitcoin (HEADS), bets $10
Bot: 🎰 FLIPPING COIN...
Bot: [Bitcoin Sticker Appears] 🪙
Bot: 🪙 COIN FLIP RESULT
     🎯 Your Choice: HEADS (Bitcoin)
     🎰 Result: HEADS (Bitcoin)
     The crypto coin sticker shows the result!
Bot: 🎉 YOU WIN! ...
```

## 🔍 How to Verify Stickers Are Being Sent

### Method 1: Check Bot Logs
When players use coinflip, look for these log entries:

**Successful Send:**
```
🎯 Attempting to send heads sticker. Available stickers: 1
📤 Sending sticker ID: CAACAgEAAxkBAAEPfLto... to chat 123456789
✅ Sticker sent successfully! Message ID: 12345
✅ Successfully completed sticker send for heads
```

**If Stickers Fail:**
```
❌ Sticker sending failed: [error type]: [error message]
Traceback: [detailed traceback for debugging]
```

### Method 2: Use /teststicker Command
The bot now has a test command:
```
/teststicker
```

This will:
1. Attempt to send Bitcoin sticker
2. Attempt to send Ethereum sticker
3. Show success/failure for each
4. Display message IDs if successful

### Method 3: Play the Game
Simply play coinflip and watch for:
- The crypto sticker appearing in chat
- The result message referencing the sticker
- Logs confirming successful send

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Stickers Don't Appear:

#### 1. Check Logs First
Look for the error message:
```
❌ Sticker sending failed: [specific error]
```

#### 2. Common Issues & Solutions

**"Invalid sticker file ID"**
- The sticker ID may have expired
- Solution: Get fresh sticker IDs from a current message

**"Chat not found"**
- Bot is trying to send to wrong chat
- Solution: Verify `query.message.chat_id` is correct

**"Bot was blocked by user"**
- User has blocked the bot
- Solution: User needs to unblock and restart

**Stickers enabled but fallback used**
- Logs will show why stickers failed
- Dice animation acts as backup

#### 3. Fallback Behavior
If stickers fail, the bot automatically:
1. Logs the error with full details
2. Falls back to slot machine dice animation
3. Still shows the game result clearly
