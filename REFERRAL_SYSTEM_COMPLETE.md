## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates

**users table** (existing columns used):
- `referral_code` - Unique code for each user
- `referred_by` - Code of referrer (if any)
- `referral_earnings` - Total earned from referrals
- `referral_count` - Number of successful referrals

**referrals table** (existing, updated):
- `referrer_id` - User who referred
- `referee_id` - User who was referred
- `referral_code` - Code used
- `bonus_paid` - Total commission paid to referrer
- `total_referee_wagered` - Total amount referee has bet
- `commission_earned` - Total commission (same as bonus_paid)
- `status` - 'pending' or 'active'

### Key Functions

#### `generate_referral_code(user_id: int) -> str`
Generates unique referral code using MD5 hash

#### `get_or_create_referral_code(user_id: int) -> str`

#### `get_referral_link(bot_username: str, referral_code: str) -> str`

### Integration Points

#### 1. **Start Command** (`/start`)
- Detects referral code from deep link parameter
- Processes referral for new users
- Shows welcome bonus notification

#### 2. **Game Session Logging**
Updated `log_game_session()` function:
```python

    await process_referral_commission(user_id, loss_amount)
```

#### 3. **Referral Command** (`/referral`)
Shows:
- Unique referral link
- Current statistics
- Commission explanation
