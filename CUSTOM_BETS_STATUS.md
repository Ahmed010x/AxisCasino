## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN

Each game needs 3 components:

### **1. Updated Bet Menu**
Show buttons: `$1, $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, Half, All-In, Custom`

### **2. Request Custom Bet Function**
Prompts user to type custom amount with balance display

### **3. Handle Custom Bet Input**
Validates and processes the typed amount

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION FOR REMAINING GAMES

Since this is a large task, I recommend we implement it **one game at a time** to ensure quality and avoid errors.

## 📝 NEXT STEPS - YOUR CHOICE

**Option A: Implement All Games Now**
- I'll update Dice, Blackjack, Roulette, and Poker all at once
- Takes longer but gets everything done
- Higher chance of errors due to size

**Option B: Implement One Game at a Time** (Recommended)
- Start with **Dice** (simplest game)
- Test it thoroughly
- Then move to Blackjack, Roulette, Poker
- Better quality control

**Option C: Quick Implementation**
- I'll create complete files for all games
- You can review and test at your pace

## 💡 RECOMMENDATION

**Let's start with Dice:**

2. Perfect for testing the pattern
3. Once working, copy to other games

**Would you like me to:**
- ✅ **A)** Implement Dice with custom bets first?
- ✅ **B)** Implement all 4 games at once?
- ✅ **C)** Just show you the code changes needed?
