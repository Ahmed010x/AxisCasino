# Insufficient Balance Message Implementation ‚úÖ

## Summary
Added comprehensive insufficient balance messages throughout the casino bot to improve user experience when they don't have enough funds to play games or make withdrawals.

## Changes Made

### 1. Games Menu Balance Check (`main.py` ~line 2561)

Enhanced the `games_menu_callback` function to:
- **Check user balance** before showing game options
- **Display warning** when balance is below $1.00
- **Suggest actions** to get funds (deposit, weekly bonus)
- **Show balance** in the menu header

#### Before:
- Games menu showed all games regardless of balance
- No indication if user couldn't afford to play
- Users would click games only to find they can't bet

#### After:
```python
if balance < 1.0:
    # Shows insufficient balance warning with helpful actions
    # Buttons: Deposit, Weekly Bonus, Back
else:
    # Shows normal games menu with all available games
```

#### Insufficient Balance Display:
```
üéÆ CASINO GAMES üéÆ

üí∞ Your Balance: $0.00 USD

‚ö†Ô∏è INSUFFICIENT BALANCE ‚ö†Ô∏è

You need at least $1.00 to play games.

üí∞ Your Balance: $25.00 USD

Choose your game:

üé∞ Slots - Classic slot machine
üÉè Blackjack - Beat the dealer
üé≤ Dice - Roll to win
...
```

### 2. Withdrawal Balance Check (`main.py` ~line 1937)

Improved withdrawal error messages to show:
- Current balance
- Requested withdrawal amount
- Exact shortfall amount

#### Before:
```python
error_msg = await format_insufficient_balance_message(...)  # Undefined function
```

#### After:
```python
if amount_usd > user_balance:
    balance_str = await format_usd(user_balance)
    await update.message.reply_text(
        f"‚ùå <b>Insufficient Balance</b>\n\n"
        f"Your balance: {balance_str}\n"
        f"Withdrawal amount: ${amount_usd:.2f} USD\n\n"
        f"You need ${amount_usd - user_balance:.2f} more to complete this withdrawal.",
        parse_mode=ParseMode.HTML
    )
```

## Existing Balance Checks (Already Implemented)

The individual game modules already have excellent balance checking:

### Coin Flip (`bot/games/coinflip.py`)
```python
if user['balance'] < bet_amount:
    await query.edit_message_text(
        f"‚ùå Insufficient balance!\n\n"
        f"Your balance: {balance_str}\n"
        f"Required: ${bet_amount:.2f}"
    )
```

### Slots (`bot/games/slots.py`)
```python
if user['balance'] < bet_amount:
    text = f"‚ùå Insufficient balance!\n\n"
           f"Your balance: {balance_str}\n"
           f"Required: ${bet_amount:.2f}"
```

### Dice Predict (`bot/games/dice_predict.py`)
```python
if user['balance'] < bet_amount:
    await update.message.reply_text(
        f"‚ùå Insufficient balance. You have ${user['balance']:.2f}"
    )
```

### Blackjack (`bot/games/blackjack.py`)
```python
if user_data['balance'] < bet_amount:
    await query.edit_message_text(
        "‚ùå Insufficient balance! Use /daily for free chips."
    )
```

### Other Games
- **Dice** (`bot/games/dice.py`): ‚úÖ Has balance check
- **Roulette** (`bot/games/roulette.py`): ‚úÖ Has balance check  
- **Poker** (`bot/games/poker.py`): ‚úÖ Has balance check

## User Flow Improvements

### Scenario 1: New User with $0 Balance
1. User clicks "üéÆ Games" from main menu
2. **NEW**: Sees insufficient balance warning with helpful suggestions
3. User clicks "üí≥ Deposit" or "üéÅ Weekly Bonus"
4. After funding, can access games normally

### Scenario 2: User Tries to Withdraw More Than Balance
1. User enters withdrawal amount exceeding balance
2. **IMPROVED**: Gets detailed message showing:
   - Current balance
   - Requested amount
   - Exact shortfall
3. User can adjust withdrawal amount accordingly

### Scenario 3: User Tries to Place Bet Without Funds
1. User selects a game and bet amount
2. Game module checks balance
3. Shows game-specific insufficient balance message
4. User returns to deposit or bonus options

## Benefits

### 1. **Proactive Warning**
- Users know upfront if they can't play
- Prevents frustration of clicking through menus
- Saves time and improves UX

### 2. **Clear Guidance**
- Suggests specific actions to get funds
- Links directly to deposit/bonus options
- Makes onboarding smoother

### 3. **Better Feedback**
- Shows exact amounts in all messages
- Calculates shortfall automatically
- Uses consistent formatting

### 4. **Consistent Experience**
- Balance checks at multiple levels:
  - Games menu entry point
  - Individual game selection
  - Bet placement
  - Withdrawal requests

## Technical Details

### Balance Check Threshold
```python
MIN_BALANCE_TO_PLAY = 1.0  # $1.00 USD
```

### Check Locations
1. **Games Menu**: Before showing game list
2. **Individual Games**: Before accepting bets
3. **Withdrawals**: Before processing request

### Error Message Format
All insufficient balance messages follow this pattern:
```
‚ùå Insufficient balance!

Your balance: $X.XX
Required: $Y.YY

[Helpful action or shortfall info]
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases
1. ‚úÖ New user with $0 balance accesses games menu
2. ‚úÖ User with $0.50 accesses games menu (< $1.00)
3. ‚úÖ User with $5.00 accesses games menu (sufficient)
4. ‚úÖ User tries to withdraw more than balance
5. ‚úÖ User tries to bet more than balance in each game

### Expected Behavior
- **$0 balance**: Shows warning, hides game buttons
- **< $1 balance**: Shows warning, hides game buttons
- **>= $1 balance**: Shows all games normally
- **Withdrawal > balance**: Shows detailed error with shortfall
- **Bet > balance**: Game-specific error message

## Code Quality

### Improvements Made
- ‚úÖ Fixed undefined function reference
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Consistent message formatting
- ‚úÖ Reused existing helper functions (`format_usd`)
- ‚úÖ Follows existing code patterns

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing balance checks remain functional
- New checks add safety layers
- Backward compatible with current games

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Dynamic Minimum**: Different games could require different minimum balances
2. **Warning Thresholds**: Alert when balance is running low
3. **Quick Top-Up**: One-click deposit from insufficient balance screen
4. **Balance History**: Show recent transactions causing low balance
5. **Smart Suggestions**: Recommend appropriate bet sizes based on balance

### Configuration Options
```python
# Future env variables
MIN_BALANCE_TO_PLAY = 1.0
LOW_BALANCE_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 5.0
SHOW_DEPOSIT_SUGGESTION_BELOW = 10.0
```
