# Insufficient Balance Message Implementation ‚úÖ

## Summary
Added comprehensive insufficient balance messages throughout the casino bot to improve user experience when they don't have enough funds to play games or make withdrawals.

## Changes Made

### 1. Games Menu Balance Check (`main.py` ~line 2561)

Enhanced the `games_menu_callback` function to:
- **Check user balance** before showing game options
- **Display warning banner** when balance is below $1.00
- **Show all games** even with insufficient balance (users can browse)
- **Add quick funding buttons** when balance is low
- **Show balance** in the menu header

#### Before:
- Games menu showed all games regardless of balance
- No indication if user couldn't afford to play
- Users would click games only to find they can't bet

#### After:
```python
if balance < 1.0:
    # Shows warning banner at top
    # Lists all games (grayed out/informational)
    # Adds quick Deposit & Bonus buttons
else:
    # Shows normal games menu with all available games
```

#### Insufficient Balance Display:
```

### 2. Withdrawal Balance Check (`main.py` ~line 1937)

Improved withdrawal error messages to show:
- Current balance
- Requested withdrawal amount
- Exact shortfall amount

#### Before:
```python
error_msg = await format_insufficient_balance_message(...)  # Undefined function
```

#### After:
```python
if amount_usd > user_balance:
    balance_str = await format_usd(user_balance)
    await update.message.reply_text(
        f"‚ùå <b>Insufficient Balance</b>\n\n"
        f"Your balance: {balance_str}\n"
        f"Withdrawal amount: ${amount_usd:.2f} USD\n\n"
        f"You need ${amount_usd - user_balance:.2f} more to complete this withdrawal.",
        parse_mode=ParseMode.HTML
    )
```

## Existing Balance Checks (Already Implemented)

The individual game modules already have excellent balance checking:

### Coin Flip (`bot/games/coinflip.py`)
```python
if user['balance'] < bet_amount:
    await query.edit_message_text(
        f"‚ùå Insufficient balance!\n\n"
        f"Your balance: {balance_str}\n"
        f"Required: ${bet_amount:.2f}"
    )
```

### Slots (`bot/games/slots.py`)
```python
if user['balance'] < bet_amount:
    text = f"‚ùå Insufficient balance!\n\n"
           f"Your balance: {balance_str}\n"
           f"Required: ${bet_amount:.2f}"
```

### Dice Predict (`bot/games/dice_predict.py`)
```python
if user['balance'] < bet_amount:
    await update.message.reply_text(
        f"‚ùå Insufficient balance. You have ${user['balance']:.2f}"
    )
```

### Blackjack (`bot/games/blackjack.py`)
```python
if user_data['balance'] < bet_amount:
    await query.edit_message_text(
        "‚ùå Insufficient balance! Use /daily for free chips."
    )
```

### Other Games
- **Dice** (`bot/games/dice.py`): ‚úÖ Has balance check
- **Roulette** (`bot/games/roulette.py`): ‚úÖ Has balance check  
- **Poker** (`bot/games/poker.py`): ‚úÖ Has balance check

## User Flow Improvements

### Scenario 1: New User with $0 Balance
1. User clicks "üéÆ Games" from main menu
2. **NEW**: Sees warning banner at top of games list
3. **NEW**: Can browse all available games (informational)
4. **NEW**: Quick access buttons for "üí≥ Deposit" and "üéÅ Bonus"
5. If user clicks a game, individual game will show insufficient balance error
6. After funding, can play games normally

### Scenario 2: User Tries to Withdraw More Than Balance
1. User enters withdrawal amount exceeding balance
2. **IMPROVED**: Gets detailed message showing:
   - Current balance
   - Requested amount
   - Exact shortfall
3. User can adjust withdrawal amount accordingly

### Scenario 3: User Tries to Place Bet Without Funds
1. User selects a game and bet amount
2. Game module checks balance
3. Shows game-specific insufficient balance message
4. User returns to deposit or bonus options

## Benefits

### 1. **Proactive Warning**
- Users see warning banner upfront if balance is low
- Can still browse and explore all available games
- Quick funding buttons added when needed
- Prevents confusion while maintaining discoverability

### 2. **Clear Guidance**
- Warning banner shows minimum balance needed
- Quick-access funding buttons appear when needed
- Links directly to deposit/bonus options
- Makes onboarding smoother while allowing exploration

### 3. **Better Feedback**
- Shows exact amounts in all messages
- Calculates shortfall automatically
- Uses consistent formatting

### 4. **Consistent Experience**
- Balance checks at multiple levels:
  - Games menu entry point (warning banner)
  - Individual game selection (full error message)
  - Bet placement (detailed balance check)
  - Withdrawal requests (insufficient funds error)
- Users can always browse games, even without funds
- Funding options always accessible when needed

## Technical Details

### Balance Check Threshold
```python
MIN_BALANCE_TO_PLAY = 1.0  # $1.00 USD
```

### Check Locations
1. **Games Menu**: Before showing game list
2. **Individual Games**: Before accepting bets
3. **Withdrawals**: Before processing request

### Error Message Format
All insufficient balance messages follow this pattern:
```
‚ùå Insufficient balance!

Your balance: $X.XX
Required: $Y.YY

[Helpful action or shortfall info]
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases
1. ‚úÖ New user with $0 balance accesses games menu ‚Üí Shows warning banner + all games + funding buttons
2. ‚úÖ User with $0.50 accesses games menu (< $1.00) ‚Üí Shows warning banner + all games + funding buttons
3. ‚úÖ User with $5.00 accesses games menu (sufficient) ‚Üí Shows normal menu without warning
4. ‚úÖ User with $0 clicks a game button ‚Üí Game shows insufficient balance error
5. ‚úÖ User tries to withdraw more than balance ‚Üí Shows detailed error with shortfall
6. ‚úÖ User tries to bet more than balance in each game ‚Üí Game-specific error message

### Expected Behavior
- **$0 balance**: Shows warning banner, displays all games, adds funding buttons
- **< $1 balance**: Shows warning banner, displays all games, adds funding buttons
- **>= $1 balance**: Shows all games normally, no warning banner
- **Click game with $0**: Individual game shows insufficient balance error
- **Withdrawal > balance**: Shows detailed error with shortfall
- **Bet > balance**: Game-specific error message

## Code Quality

### Improvements Made
- ‚úÖ Fixed undefined function reference
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Consistent message formatting
- ‚úÖ Reused existing helper functions (`format_usd`)
- ‚úÖ Follows existing code patterns

### No Breaking Changes

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Dynamic Minimum**: Different games could require different minimum balances
2. **Warning Thresholds**: Alert when balance is running low
3. **Quick Top-Up**: One-click deposit from insufficient balance screen
4. **Balance History**: Show recent transactions causing low balance
5. **Smart Suggestions**: Recommend appropriate bet sizes based on balance

### Configuration Options
