## Technical Implementation

### Game Flow
1. User selects bowling or darts from prediction games menu
2. User chooses 1-3 outcomes to predict
3. User selects bet amount ($1, $5, $10, $25, $50, $100, or custom)
4. Bot deducts bet from user balance
5. Bot sends animated emoji (🎳 or 🎯)
6. Telegram returns emoji value (1-6)
7. Bot maps emoji value to game outcome
8. Bot checks if outcome matches user's predictions
9. If match: User wins (bet × multiplier added to balance)
10. If no match: User loses (bet already deducted)
11. Result message shown with detailed information

### Emoji Animation
Both games use Telegram's native dice API:
```python
# Bowling
bowling_message = await query.message.reply_dice(emoji="🎳")
dice_value = bowling_message.dice.value

# Darts
darts_message = await query.message.reply_dice(emoji="🎯")
dice_value = darts_message.dice.value
```

### Outcome Mapping Logic

#### Bowling
```python
if dice_value == 1:
    outcome = "gutter"
elif dice_value in [2, 3]:
    outcome = "few_pins"
elif dice_value in [4, 5]:
    outcome = "many_pins"
elif dice_value == 6:
    outcome = "strike"
```

#### Darts
```python
if dice_value in [1, 2]:
    outcome = "outer"
elif dice_value in [3, 4]:
    outcome = "middle"
elif dice_value == 5:
    outcome = "inner"
elif dice_value == 6:
    outcome = "bullseye"
```

### Win Condition Check
```python
outcome_index = game_info['options'].index(outcome)
player_won = outcome_index in selections
```
