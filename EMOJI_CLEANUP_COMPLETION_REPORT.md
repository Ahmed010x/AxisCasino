# Basketball Prediction Emoji Cleanup - Completion Report

## ✅ Task Completed Successfully

**Objective**: Remove extra unnecessary emojis from the basketball prediction game to create a cleaner, more focused display.

## 🧹 Changes Made

### 1. Option Names Simplified
**Before**: `["🔴 Stuck", "❌ Miss", "✅ In"]`
