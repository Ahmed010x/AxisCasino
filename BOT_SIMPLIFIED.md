# Bot Simplification Report

## Overview
Successfully simplified the Telegram casino bot by removing undefined game handlers and streamlining functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Undefined Game Callbacks
- Removed references to `handle_prediction_callback` (not defined)
- Removed references to `handle_basketball_callback` (not defined) 
- Removed references to `handle_coinflip_callback` (not defined)
- Fixed incorrect reference to `handle_roulette_callback` (should be `game_roulette_callback`)

### 2. Simplified Callback Handler
**Before:** Had 7 games with broken handlers
**After:** Now has 4 working games with proper error handling

Working games:
- üé∞ Slots (`game_slots_callback`)
- üÉè Blackjack (`game_blackjack_callback`) 
- üé≤ Dice (`game_dice_callback`)
- üéØ Roulette (`game_roulette_callback`)

Unsupported games now show "Coming Soon" message instead of crashing.

### 3. Updated Games Menu
- Removed non-functional game buttons (Coin Flip, Basketball, Prediction)
- Updated game descriptions to only mention working games
- Cleaner layout with 2x2 grid of working games

### 4. Removed Broken Test Command
- Removed `test_sticker_command` that imported non-existent `bot.games.coinflip` module
- Eliminated import errors and unnecessary debugging code

### 5. Streamlined Text Input Handler
- `handle_text_input_main` already properly simplified
- Only handles deposit/withdrawal states
- Ignores unexpected input gracefully
